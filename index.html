                <header><h2>Current Success</h2></header>
                <p>In the Big Sky and FCS the Vandals have been much more competitive then they were in the FBS and the drop down has been considered a success espeically with the most recent Coaching Staff.
                            However, the most recent coach, Coach Jason Eck, and many of his coordinators and assitants have left for higher paying jobs in the FBS at the University of New Mexico (Lobos).
                            The Idaho Vandals just announced Coach Ecks replacement in late December 2024, Thomas Ford a previous assistant under Coach Eck at Idaho became the Idaho Vandals 37th Head Coach.</p>
